# Abstraction nothing but partial implementation

# Benefits of Abstraction
# Modularity: Code can be divided into smaller parts, making it easier to manage and modify.
# Reusability: Abstract classes provide a template for other classes, promoting code reusability.
# Improved Code Organization: Abstraction helps organize code by separating what a class does from how it does it.
# Ease of Maintenance: Changes to implementation details donâ€™t affect the interface, making maintenance easier.
