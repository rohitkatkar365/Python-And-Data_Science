# A module in Python is a file containing Python code, which can include variables, functions, classes, and runnable code. 

# Why Use Modules?
# Organization: Break your code into separate files based on functionality.
# Reusability: Write code once and reuse it across multiple programs.
# Maintainability: Easier to manage, update, and debug.
# Namespace Management: Avoids naming conflicts by encapsulating code in separate namespaces.

def add(a,b):
    print(a+b)
